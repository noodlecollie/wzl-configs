Add the following to ~/.ssh/config, swapping "id_ed25519" for whatever the key file's name is:

Host github.com
        IgnoreUnknown AddKeysToAgent,UseKeychain
        UseKeychain yes
        AddKeysToAgent yes
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

This should stop the terminal always asking for your SSH key password, which is particularly
useful for Git LFS which otherwise asks for authentication for every file.
